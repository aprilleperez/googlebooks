# Google Books

## Description
This activity was to exercise and exhaust knowledge on understanding the way a fully functioning code works. I had to add comments to every aspect of the working app, and ideally gain a higher level of understanding of how MERN works together. 

## Languages
HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node, Express, MongoDB

## IMPORTANT!
Please make sure to npm install both on the frontend and backend portions of the side, since node_modules havve been excluded from the upload. To start a local intance of the app, use npm start to load up on localhost 3000(frontend)/3001(backend)
