# googlebooks

## Description
This activity was to exercise and exhaust knowledge on understanding the way a fully functioning code works. I had to add comments to every aspect of the working app, and ideally gain a higher level of understanding of how MERN works together. 

## Languages
HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node, Express, MongoDB

## IMPORTANT!
Please make sure to npm install both on the frontend and backend portions of the side, since node_modules havve been excluded from the upload. To start a local intance of the app, use npm start to load up on localhost 3000(frontend)/3001(backend)

## Takeaways
It was greatly beneficial to have a working solution to dig through and comment on my understanding of. In terms of backend, I feel that I understand the flow a lot more clearly now, and the concept of "two apps working as one." I also feel a lot more familiar with React and the parent/child relationship between components and when they are rendered to the app.

# Please see comments throughout my files
Everything in "client" folder is related to frontend, whereas everything outside of "client" folder is related to backend and the MVC/server structure.
